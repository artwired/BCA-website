            I have been developing this style of artwork since 1998. It all
            started with the rise in popularity of tribal tattoo art at around
            the same time. I liked the way it looked but wanted to put my own
            spin on it. If I'm being honest.. I couldn't get the mirroring
            effect right and out of frustration just started to create random
            line work. It was fun because I could interpret figures and animals,
            insects, etc out of the finished works. Wanting to figure out a way
            to elevate the style I decided to try and completely fill the
            artboards to see how it turned out. I loved the results and have
            been trying to expand on my style ever since!

                It was around 2011 that I began to experiment with expanding my
                tribal art style to fill entire artboard surfaces. I played
                around with line weights and scale to create depth and more
                interesting compositions. I worked hard to try and control /
                guide the movement of the viewers eyes accross my work.

                After getting feedback from my fans that they were wondering how
                the art would look if I added in some colour, I decided to give
                it shot. My studies in brand design also led me the idea of
                niching down and working with images of street dancers in an
                effort to increase interest and spread a more positive brand
                message.

        <p>This piece was inspired by Drum & Bass dancers dancing full tilt. I initially drew in the dancers and took a loose approach to the rest of the artworks development. Early on I recognized the shape of a lions head coming out so I decided to try and abstractly work that into the full frame of the artboard. I felt like the orange tone lent an especially passionate tone to the overall feel of the piece.</p>

        <p>In this artwork I wanted to try and use the flowing stacked lines to dictate the movement of the peice. This was drawn comepletely intuitively and any percieved subject matter is comepletely incidental. Once I had completed the peice I felt it had almost a tropical kind of feel to it maybe during typhoon season.</p>
