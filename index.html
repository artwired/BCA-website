            I have been developing this style of artwork since 1998. It all
            started with the rise in popularity of tribal tattoo art at around
            the same time. I liked the way it looked but wanted to put my own
            spin on it. If I'm being honest.. I couldn't get the mirroring
            effect right and out of frustration just started to create random
            line work. It was fun because I could interpret figures and animals,
            insects, etc out of the finished works. Wanting to figure out a way
            to elevate the style I decided to try and completely fill the
            artboards to see how it turned out. I loved the results and have
            been trying to expand on my style ever since!

                  It was around 2011 that began to experiment with expanding my
                  tribal art style to fill entire artboard surfaces. I played
                  around with line weights and scale to create depth and more
                  interesting compositions. I worked hard to try and control the
                  movement of the viewers eyes accross my work.

                <p>
                  After getting feedback from fans that they were wondering how
                  the art would look if I added in some colour I decided to give
                  it shot. My studies in brand design also led me the idea of
                  niching down and working in images of street dancers in an
                  effort to spread a more positive brand message.
